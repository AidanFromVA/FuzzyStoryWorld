## Project Purpose
> The purpose of this proposal is to develop a game app for children. It has created a cute atmosphere to suit the emotions of the younger age group, which is the main consumer group, and plans to produce it on the Android platform. We plan to produce a fairy tale app for children. The first fairy tale begins with â€˜Hansel and Gretelâ€™.
>  
> The production period is scheduled for 4 weeks from 21-08-02 to 2021-08-31.
--------------
## Project Prospect
> There are reports that the age group using smartphones is gradually decreasing. Unlike the older generation, who first encountered cell phones as adults, children these days use cell phones as early as childhood and own their own cell phones from the age of eight. The smartphone usage rate is said to have reached 75%. As consumption has increased, demand has increased, and the supply of items targeting those in their teens and twenties is already overflowing. Unlike this, we have targeted preschool children as our main consumer base and plan to bring in profitability through advertising or paying fees.
--------------
## Project Idea
> The importance of cultural education for young children has been highlighted for a long time. In the case of young children, rather than analyzing literary works, they experience them and learn from them.
>
> Through cultural education, aesthetic sensibility can be aroused through various experiences, and imagination and creativity can be developed through literary experiences.
>
> In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics emphasized the importance of reading storybooks aloud, and it was said that there was a big difference in language development ability and academic achievement between children who read aloud to children and children who did not.
>
> We paid attention to the importance of literary works during this period of infants and toddlers, and by adding game features to literary works that can be boring, we created an environment where children can learn without getting bored, such as their emotional development and quickness and creativity through games. paid attention to.
